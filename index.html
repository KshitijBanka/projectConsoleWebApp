        <h1>Project on Console</h1>
        <p>Visual Studio is a great coding platform that helps a lot. You can click on Open folder and then upload a folder where you can create files(example 'index.html') and then code.</p>
        <p>You can print different things on the console for testing purposes. To open it, you have to right click, click on inspect and then press Console. You'll then be able to see the output. To write a code to print something on the console, you have to type: console.log() and enter anything inside. For strings, put it in quotes.</p>
        <script>
            console.log('My first console project');
            var first_name="Kshitij ";
            var last_name="Banka";
            var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
            console.log(full_name);
            var num1=891;
            var num2=352;
            var Add=num1 + num2;
            console.log(Add);
            var subtract=num1-num2;
            console.log(subtract);
            var multiply=num1*num2;
            console.log(multiply);
            var divide=num1/num2;
            console.log(divide);
